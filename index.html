      <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
      Thank you for using XXYY! We wrote this policy to help you understand what information we collect, how we use it, 
      and what choices you have. Some of the concepts below are a little technical, 
      but we've tried our best to explain things in a simple and clear way.
      Please read this privacy policy carefully and we welcome your questions and comments on this policy.
    
      <h2>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
      When you create an account with XXYY, you give us your full name and email address, and create a username and password. 
      If you want, you can give us a pseudonym instead of your legal name.
      <br><br>
      Your user profile helps you customize your account and connect with other XXYY users. 
      Your profile automatically includes your name and username. You can also add a profile picture and whatever else you’d like in the “Profile” field.
      <br><br>
      To help you connect with other XXYY users and to personalize your XXYY experience, we may ask for additional information, including your contacts, location or a list of the apps on your mobile device.  
      If you create an account after August 31, 2017, we will collect a list of the installed apps on your mobile device to improve and personalize your experience. We don’t make recommendations based on sensitive information.
      <br><br>

      your IP address and the date and time of each request you make to XXYY.
      <br><br>
      In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device your are using XXYY on, including what type of of device is, 
      what operating system you are using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of the information often
      depends on what type of device you are using and its settings.
    
      <h2>HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
      We use the information we collect to provide our products to you and make them better, 
      develop new products, protect XXYY and our users. For example:
      <br><br>
